Abstract Factory Pattern
========================

Using an abstract Factory it is possible to create the desired object type without making the instantiated class aware of it.

In this example I can create different types of Goos by changing the factory.

Another example is in Starcraft where the player choses one race and have their base and units spawn accordingly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8_wwa90tzM
