ChainOfResponsibility Pattern
=============================

One class has a responsability and when it has done all it could it tries to reach the next class in the chain to continue the work and so on...

In this example one class is responsible for rendering Megaman charging the level 1 power and when the responsability of this class ends it reaches the next resposable class in the chain and start working rendering the level 2 power.

Another example is in Starcraft where units can heal others using the chain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtR2dVXdVGo

For a basic example there is also a dude in a bank: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O28YpB4fo18
